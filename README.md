# Jumpwar
# Turnbased single-player space combat game for 1 player with animations and simple sound, help included in the game...
- Converted the .wav files to .ogg, started using file.play() instead of mixer.music.play(), has improved performance
- Enemies now eat asteroids when severely damaged
- Made changes to enemylist (were enemy data is stored)
- Cleaned up code where sound and picture files kept reloading, game now runs without crashing
